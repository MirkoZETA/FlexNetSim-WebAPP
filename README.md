# FlexNetSim-WebAPP

A web-based playground for simple optical network simulations using the Flex Net Sim C++ library, designed as an introduction to its core capabilities. Built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), it offers an interactive interface for configuring network topologies, running basic simulations, and viewing real-time results. Supports up to three simultaneous simulations for easy comparison.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation Interface**: Run optical network simulations with configurable parameters
- **Multi-Simulation Support**: Run up to 3 different simulations simultaneously for comparison
- **3-Stage Workflow**: Configure network topology, set simulation parameters, and view results
- **Real-time Results**: Watch simulation progress in real-time with formatted output

## Recent Changes

- Redesigned tab interface for improved usability
- Improved simulation progress reporting and error handling

## Backend API

This app connects to the FlexNetSim API which provides simulation capabilities. For API details, see the [FlexNetSim-API](https://github.com/MirkoZETA/FlexNetSim-API).
